# 👋 Welcome to the world of ThatKid!

Like the name suggests, I'm ThatKid, yk ThatKid that thinks he knows everything. Anyway!
If you see my code around here, you probably know I love experimenting and building cool stuff—especially in the Minecraft universe.

## 🛠️ What I Can Do

- **Kotlin** – My main language (and where I feel most at home)
- Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript – I get by pretty well!
- HTML – Not bad at all
- CSS – ...let's just say it's a work in progress

## 🌱 What’s Next?

- Planning to tackle **C++** soon (wish me luck!)

## 🚧 Current Projects

### Fractured Hearts (Soul Bound plugin)
Right now, I'm working on a custom Minecraft plugin called **Fractured Hearts** (check it out at [`Soul Bound`](https://github.com/ThatKidCooks/Soul-Bound)).  
I'm building this with [@kernelpanicdreams](https://github.com/kernelpanicdreams)—we're aiming to make something unique. - Wish us luck.

### Vex V5 Push Back (Frij Vex Team)
Also simaltaniously I'm doing robotics at school. Last year Frij made it to Worlds and now I've joined. I hope I can also help the team. If your looking for
our code you can check it out at [`Frij Robotics Code`](https://github.com/moooeg/vrc-push-back)
