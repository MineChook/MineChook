# Welcome to the world of Chickens

Like the name suggests, I love Chickens.
If you see my code around here, you probably know I love experimenting and building cool stuff.

## What I Do

- **Java** where I'm doing well at (blame minecraft for choosing Java so if I want to mod it I have to learn it).
- Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++ – I get by pretty well!
- HTML – Not bad at all
- CSS – ...let's just say it's a work in progress

## What’s Next?

- Maybe eventually tackling Rust.

## Current Projects

### Vex V5 Push Back (Frij Vex Team)
Right now I'm doing robotics at school. Last year Frij made it to Worlds and now I've joined. I hope I can also help the team. If your looking for
our code you can check it out at [`Frij Robotics Code`](https://github.com/moooeg/vrc-push-back)
