# 👋 Welcome to the world of Chickens

Like the name suggests, I love Chickens.
If you see my code around here, you probably know I love experimenting and building cool stuff.

## 🛠️ What I Can Do

- **Kotlin** – My main language (and where I feel most at home)
- Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++ – I get by pretty well!
- HTML – Not bad at all
- CSS – ...let's just say it's a work in progress

## 🌱 What’s Next?

- Maybe eventually tackling Rust.

## 🚧 Current Projects

### Chess Engine
Right now, I'm working on a C++ project for me and my Dad. **A Chess Application that lets you play against bots and other people. The chess engine also does Analysis of your games so you can always improve. (check it out at [`Chess`](https://github.com/MineChook/Chess).  

### Vex V5 Push Back (Frij Vex Team)
Also simaltaniously I'm doing robotics at school. Last year Frij made it to Worlds and now I've joined. I hope I can also help the team. If your looking for
our code you can check it out at [`Frij Robotics Code`](https://github.com/moooeg/vrc-push-back)
